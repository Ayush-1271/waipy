"Eye of Thundera - give me sight beyond sight".
 
When Lion-O's friends were in danger, he invoked the power of Thundera through the Sword of Omens. The sword has the mystical Eye of Thundera, that gave to Lion-O the sight beyond sight.

Wavelet analysis is similar to the Eye of Thundera, in the sense that it'll give you the power to localize a pulse in frequency and time domain - sight beyond stationarity.

This guide includes a description of a Python module named waipy that calculates the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and significance tests based on Torrence and Compo (1998). It provides further a Cross Wavelet Analysis (CWA) based on Maraun and Kurths(2004).
